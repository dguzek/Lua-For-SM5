This guide aims to (eventually) change that.\r\n\r\nFor now, this guide serves specifically as a bridge between SM3.95 and SM5.\r\nIf you've ever made a \"gimmck chart\" using XML for StepMania 3.95, this guide is for you.\r\n\r\nEventually, I'd like for this to become broader in scope and serve as a general introduction to SM5 theming.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\n### 0.
