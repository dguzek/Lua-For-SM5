# Section 1.2 â€“ BitmapText

*BitmapText* Actors are used to display text on the screen. As Lua tables, they
have two unique elements, `Font` and `Text`.  `Font` should be set to
any font in the current or *_fallback* theme's *./Font* directory. `Text` should
be set to a string value, but it can be left empty or not declared at all if you intend
to programmatically set the text later with the `settext()` method.


{% highlight lua linenos=table %}
-- In SM5, it is possible (and encouraged!) to create local variables
-- that have scope over the current file, like this.
local phrases = {
	"There's the boys.",
	"Just move faster.",
	"Worst in the world.",
	"#bottomstruggles"
}

return Def.ActorFrame{
	InitCommand=cmd(sleep, 9999),

	-- Remember that queuecommand() waits until the next tick of the engine's
	-- game loop to execute whatever command we are queueing.
	OnCommand=cmd(queuecommand, "ChooseAPhrase"),
	ChooseAPhraseCommand=function(self)
		-- When passed an integer, math.random() returns a random
		-- integer that is no greater than the number you pass it,
		-- but at least 1.  So, in this case, since #phrases = 4
		-- i will be assigned to 1, 2, 3 or 4.
		local i = math.random( #phrases )

		-- In contrast, playcommand() will attempt to execute immediately.
		-- playcommand() also allows us to pass a table of arguments to
		-- the next command we want to run.  In this way, we can pass
		-- variables that are otherwise local to this function of this
		-- ActorFrame to the desired function of the desired BitmapText.
		self:GetChild("CatchPhrase"):playcommand("Update", {PhraseIndex=i})
	end,

	Def.BitmapText{
		Name="CatchPhrase",
		Font="Common normal",
		InitCommand=cmd(diffuse, color("#FEDCBA"); Center),
		UpdateCommand=function(self, params)
			-- The "params" argument comes in as a table with a single element,
			-- "PhraseIndex"; use that index to get one of the string phrases from
			-- the phrases variable and set this BitmapText to display that phrase.
			self:settext( phrases[ params.PhraseIndex ] )
		end
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

The example above is admittedly rather artificial for the sake of demonstrating how to pass
variables when issuing a `playcommand()` call.  The random index `i` could have just
as easily been generated at the top of the file next to `local phrases` and not needed to
be passed between the Actors' functions.

Still, it is good to know that this can be done.  Keeping variables local (to a file, to a function,
etc.) is good practice to mitigate polluting the global Lua namespace with an abundance of
single-use variables.  In this regard, it can be helpful to know as many ways to pass those
local variables (between files, between functions, etc.) as possible.

Finally, if you sift through enough SM5 theme code, you'll likely encounter a helper function
`LoadFont()`.  It was essentially a wrapper method for Def.BitmapText{} that served to
workaround some of BitmapText's quirks/bugs that have since been fixed.  There should be
no need to use it any longer.
