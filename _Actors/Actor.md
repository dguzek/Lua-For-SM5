# Section 1.4 â€“ Actor

The *Actor* class is the most generic and lightweight StepMania Actor; all other Actors inherit from it (directly or eventually).  Using *Actor* objects directly to load an image or sound can be somewhat cumbersome; the `LoadActor()` helper function discussed later is often easier to use and more flexible.

Still, there are times when *Actor* objects can be useful.  For example, the Simply Love SM5 port uses them when we need a hook to some message broadcast by the engine but an ActorFrame isn't necessary.
