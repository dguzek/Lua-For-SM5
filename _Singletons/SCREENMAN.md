# Section 2.1 &mdash; SCREENMAN Singleton

The SCREENMAN (short for *Screen Manager*) singleton is primarily used in conjunction with its `GetTopScreen()` method to do just that â€“ get the screen that is currently on the top of StepMania's screen stack.  (This typically means the current screen.)

SCREENMAN also has a some other methods which are worth knowing, namely `SystemMessage()`.   As we'll demonstrate below, `SystemMessage()`  can be handy for quick debugging.

### GetTopScreen()

Within the context of theming and simfile scripting, calling `SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen()` will typically return screen currently being displayed in the form of a *screen* object.
 For example, calling it on ScreenGameplay will get you the gameplay screen in the form of a screen object.  Calling it on ScreenPlayerOptions wil do similarly but return the player options screen.

While there are some methods available to *all* <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/API/Lua.xml#Screen">screen objects</a> (like `AddInputCallback()` which is covered in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Examples/Arbitrary-Input.html">Chapter 4.1</a>), there are many more that depend on the class of the current Screen.  A screen object of class *ScreenGameplay* will have the method `GetLifeMeter()` which returns a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/API/Lua.xml#LifeMeter">LifeMeter</a> object.  A screen object of class *ScreenSelectMusic* will have the method `GetMusicWheel()` which returns a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/API/Lua.xml#MusicWheel">MusicWheel</a> ojbect.

Here is a small example that uses `GetTopScreen()` on ScreenSelectMusic to get a Lua reference to the MusicWheel and change the current sort of that MusicWheel.  In order for this code to work, it must be called from a theme's ScreenSelectMusic.

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Using SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen() to get ScreenSelectMusic</span>
{% highlight lua linenos=table %}
return Actor{
	
	-- InitCommand happens before the screen we want is the TopScreen,
	-- so calling GetTopScreen() during an InitCommand would fetch the
	-- screen being transitioned out of that is about to be destroyed.
	InitCommand=function(self)
		-- So, we queue a secondary command, and call GetTopScreen()
		-- from there.
		self:queuecommand("CaptureTopScreen")
	end,
	CaptureTopScreenCommand=function(self)
		-- When this function is called, StepMania's engine will be one
		-- frame past InitCommand.  By now, the screen we want will be ready.
		
		-- Since this Lua is being called on ScreenSelectMusic
		-- the topscreen variable will be a screen object of ScreenSelectMusic.
		local topscreen = SCREENMAN:GetTopScreen()
		
		-- Get a Lua reference to the engine's MusicWheel
		-- This is a Lua object of type "MusicWheel"
		local MusicWheel = topscreen:GetMusicWheel()
		
		-- Change the current sort of the MusicWheel.
		-- Fot a full list of available sorts, check the SortOrder enum
		-- as documented in the Lua API.
		MusicWheel:ChangeSort("SortOrder_Artist")
	end
}
{% endhighlight %}

Again, there are many custom methods that belong to the many different classes of screens, more than can be reasonable documented here.  For a full list, please refer to the various screen classes documented in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/API/Lua.xml">SM5 Lua API</a>.  This currently includes everything from **Class Screen**:*ActorFrame* down to **Class ScreenWithMenuElementsSimple**:*ScreenWithMenuElements* (with the exception of ScreenManager itself, of course!).

### Debugging with SystemMessage()

Using ScreenMan's `SystemMessage()` method may perhaps be the most tried-and-true means of quickly displaying debugging output to the Screen.  `SystemMessage()` accepts a string as an argument and displays it at the top of the screen for a few seconds.

Let's jump into a simple example from ScreenGameplay where we listen for and print out JudgmentMessages.  A *Judgment* is how each step is evaluated as it passes in Gameplay.  Each Judgment has a corresponding JudgmentMessage broadcast by the engine that contains information about that Judgment.

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Using SystemMessage() to print debug output</span>
{% highlight lua linenos=table %}

-- Since the engine only broadcasts JudgmentMessages to ScreenGameplay,
-- this example only makes sense and does anything in ScreenGameplay.

return Actor{
	
	JudgmentMessageCommand=function(self, params)
		-- Note that JudgementMessages will be broadcast for any human players,
		-- but to keep this example simple, we'll limit it to PLAYER_1.
		if params.Player == PLAYER_1 then
			
			-- This SystemMessage will display each judgment in string
			-- form at the top of the screen as it occurs.
			-- So, if a note passes and the player misses it,
			-- "TapNoteScore_Miss"  would be displayed at the
			-- top of the screen. 
			--
			-- A W1 judgment (Marvelous in DDR, Fantastic in ITG, etc.)
			-- would display "TapNoteScore_W1".
			-- (Note that the "W" is for window, as in "timing window.") 
			SCREENMAN:SystemMessage( params.TapNoteScore )
		end
	end
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Using SystemMessage() to display Table output

`SystemMessage()` display strings, not tables, so if in our debugging endeavors we want such functionality, we'll have to enhance SystemMessage some with custom Lua.  The *Simply Love* theme for SM5 <a href="https://github.com/dguzek/Simply-Love-SM5/blob/master/Scripts/SL-Utilities.lua#L51-L72">includes some helper functions</a>.  As the author of that theme, I encourage you to use that code in your own scripting/theming endeavors.  One way to do this is to include a copy of **SL-Utilities.lua** in the *./Scripts* directory of your current theme.

The function defined in **SL-Utilities.lua** that is relevant here is `SM()`  which is short for SystemMessage.  Assuming that SL-Utilities.lua is copied into the current theme's Scripts directory and loaded (by restarting StepMania or pressing <kbd>Control F2</kbd>), this example will print table of the which steps were just judged in a JudgmentMessage.

<span class="CodeExample-Title">using SM() to display a small Lua table</span>
{% highlight lua linenos=table %}
return Actor{
	JudgmentMessageCommand=function(self, params)
	-- Again, limit to  PLAYER_1 for a more simple example.
	if params.Player == PLAYER_1 then
		-- SystemMessage a stringified table of note columns 
		-- as each judgment occurs
		SM( params.Notes )
	end
}
{% endhighlight %}

The screenshot below shows that columns 4 and 1 (a left-right jump) were just missed.

 Please note that this debugging approach has limited usefulness as large Lua tables can easily contain more data than StepMania's window can reasonably display.  In such situations, a proper Lua `Trace()` is preferred.  Output from `Trace()` is written to *Logs/Log.txt*
