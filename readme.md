# Lua Scripting For StepMania 5

StepMania 5's Lua scripting capabilities are powerful but documentation is admittedly scarce.  This guide aims to (eventually) change that.

For now, this guide serves specifically as a bridge between SM3.95 and SM5.
If you've ever made a "gimmck chart" using XML for StepMania 3.95, this guide is for you.

Eventually, I'd like for this to become broader in scope and serve as a general introduction to SM5 theming.
